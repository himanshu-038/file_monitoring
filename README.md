# File monitoring script for imagery processing
The program is aimed at making sure that all the imagery files (ERS, mapinfo, PNG,etc) associated with the tilenames contained in a textfile (provided to the user) are present in the zip folder (in specific directory where imagery files are uploaded).
It logs the number of files found in the zip folder for each of the tilenames.
